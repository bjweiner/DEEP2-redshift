c  do a PCA analysis of a bunch of spectra of known redshift

      program pcanalyze


c read the spectra as FITS files

c knock out regions around sky lines?

c rebin into log space if necessary

c shift to zero redshift

c do we need to normalize, here or somewhere else?

c do continuum subtraction 

c compute mean spectrum

c subtract mean spectrum?

c weighting of regions of interest?

c diagonalize matrix

c find & print eigen values

c compute, and normalize? the eigentemplates

c plot and output eigentemplates

      end
